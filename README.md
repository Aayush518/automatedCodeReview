# Enhanced Code Analyzer

The Enhanced Code Analyzer is a magical tool that helps you analyze your Python code and provides insights into its quality and potential issues. It utilizes the power of the `pylint` tool to perform static code analysis and offers additional features to enhance your coding experience.

## Features

1. **Code Analysis:** Get a detailed analysis of your Python code's quality and potential issues using the `pylint` tool.

2. **Caching:** The analyzer intelligently caches analysis results to speed up subsequent inspections of the same code file.

3. **Average Code Quality Score:** Retrieve the average code quality score for the analyzed file, giving you an overall idea of the code's health.

4. **Common Issue Identification:** Identify the most common issues within your code, helping you focus on areas that need improvement.

5. **Easy-to-Use:** A user-friendly command-line interface guides you through the process of analyzing your code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Aayush518/automatedCodeReview.git`.

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd automatedCodeReview`.

3. Install any required dependencies using your preferred package manager.

4. Run the `main.py` script to begin the code inspection process.

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the path to the Python code file you want to analyze.

## Usage Examples

```bash
python main.py
```

After providing the path to the code file, the tool will display analysis results, average code quality score, and common issues (if any).
